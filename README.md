# DiveProMe+
Firstly the latest version online [DiveProMe+](http://scan3d.ru/DiveMePro+/)

DiveProMe+ is a Java and HTML5 decompression program that uses the Bühlmann (ZHL-16) for decompression profiles. The Bühlmann decompression model is well suited to today's technical diving.

The simple "Waterfall" GUI style provides users with an unprecedented level of control and usability. User can immediately change any part of their dive plan and instantly recalculate their profile.

Experience of control over safety factors with ZHL16A, ZHL16B, ZHL16C gradient factor method, which allows safety factors to be customized across multiple diving profiles. For example, gradient factors establish a percentage of maximum compartment pressure, which can be individually established based on individual decompression success.

DiveProMe+ calculates all types of Nitrox, Trimix, TriOx, HeliOx, OC and CCR multilevel dives. DiveProMe+ makes plans for Lost deco gas, Range plans, watches and alerts. It is designed to allow you to compare several scenario, while optimizing your parameters and gas mixes. Included Layouts for saving complex dive plans, PDF and XLS Export, Graphs and Charts, data automation export, etc. The settings allow for customized deep and extended stops, control stop times.

# Warning
WARNING! THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK OF DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS (DCS) FOR ANY DIVE PROFILE EVEN IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIVE PLAN PRESCRIBED BY DIVE TABLES. NO PROCEDURE OR DIVE TABLE WILL PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF DCS OR OXYGEN TOXICITY! An individual’s physiological make up can vary from day to day. You are strongly advised to remain well within the exposure limits provided by the planner to minimize the risk of DCS.

Please note - this program is made with the experienced and technical diver in mind. If you're relatively new to diving, you may find this program difficult to use. You're expected to know the theory behind the diving practices and procedures used here.
